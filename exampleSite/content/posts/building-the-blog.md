Pull up a chair—here’s how this site came together.

## Theme setup
- Installed Hugo Extended
- Vendored the theme into `exampleSite/themes/Campfire/`
- Fixed pagination config (`[pagination].pagerSize`)

## SEO & metadata
- Added improved Open Graph + Twitter meta via `layouts/partials/seo.html`
- Default OG image at `/images/og-default.jpg`

## Styling & UX
- Pagination UI and badges
- Better focus outlines and keyboard navigation

## What’s next
- Storytelling modes (daylight / firelight / auto)
- Reading time and related posts

It’s already cozy here—more logs for the fire coming soon.
