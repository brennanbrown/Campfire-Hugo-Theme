Today’s updates focused on usability and polish:

- Widened the main content column and increased spacing between content and sidebar on large screens.
- Ensured the footer sticks to the bottom on short pages using a flex layout.
- Added helpful sidebar modules: Recent Posts, Top Categories with counts, and a Newsletter placeholder.
- Introduced a mobile-friendly header with a hamburger menu and a theme toggle (☀️/🌙) that persists via local storage.
- Centered pagination and tightened widget spacing to improve rhythm.
- Polished tag badges and dark mode post meta contrast.

What’s next:

- Consider a featured post widget and author card in the sidebar.
- Optional: full-width hero intro for the homepage, or keep the sidebar and further tune density.

If you notice any visual quirks on different devices, let me know and I’ll iterate. 🔥
