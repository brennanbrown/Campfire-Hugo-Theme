*   **Dark Mode Support:** User feedback indicates a desire for easily adjustable dark mode functionality.

### 3. Core Functionality and Features:

*   **Minimalist Aesthetic:** 'Minimal' and 'light' themes are highly popular, suggesting a preference for clean, uncluttered designs.
*   **Personal and Portfolio Use:** A significant number of users seek themes for personal websites and portfolios.
*   **Multilingual Support:** The demand for multilingual themes is notable.
*   **SEO-friendly:** While not explicitly stated as a pain point, good SEO practices are implicitly expected for any website theme.

### 4. Addressing Pain Points Directly:
*   **Troubleshooting Guidance:** Provide clear guidance or common troubleshooting steps within the documentation to help users resolve issues.
