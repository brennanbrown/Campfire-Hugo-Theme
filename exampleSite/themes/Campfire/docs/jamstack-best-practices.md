# JAMstack Project Best Practices

## Git Best Practices:
*   **Branching Strategy:** Utilize a branching strategy such as Git Flow or feature branching to promote organized development. This allows multiple features or fixes to be developed concurrently without interfering with the main codebase.
*   **Atomic Commits:** Make small, focused commits that address a single logical change. This makes it easier to review changes, revert mistakes, and understand the project's history.
*   **Clear Commit Messages:** Write descriptive commit messages that explain *what* was changed and *why*. Follow a consistent format (e.g., Conventional Commits).

## GitHub Best Practices:
*   **Repository Structure:** Organize your repository logically with clear directories for source code, assets, documentation, etc.
*   **Issue Tracking:** Use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and project tasks. Encourage detailed issue descriptions and use labels for categorization.
*   **Pull Requests (PRs):** Use PRs for code review and collaboration. Ensure PRs are well-described, link to relevant issues, and include clear instructions for reviewers.
*   **Templates:** Utilize GitHub's issue and pull request templates to standardize contributions and ensure necessary information is provided.

## Documentation Best Practices:
*   **Comprehensive README:** A well-structured and informative `README.md` is essential. It should include:
    *   Project title and description.
    *   Installation instructions.
    *   Usage examples.
    *   Contribution guidelines.
    *   License information.
    *   Links to more detailed documentation.
*   **In-code Documentation:** Use comments and docstrings to explain complex logic, functions, and components within the codebase.
*   **Dedicated Documentation Site:** For larger projects, consider a separate documentation site (e.g., built with Docusaurus, GitBook, or even Hugo itself) for detailed guides, API references, and tutorials.
*   **Living Documentation:** Keep documentation updated as the project evolves. Outdated documentation is often worse than no documentation.

## Open Source Best Practices:
*   **Clear Licensing:** Choose an appropriate open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL) and include it in your repository.
*   **Contribution Guidelines:** Provide clear `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines that explain how others can contribute to your project (e.g., code of conduct, how to submit issues/PRs, testing procedures).
*   **Community Engagement:** Be responsive to issues and pull requests. Foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for contributors.
*   **Code of Conduct:** Implement a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to ensure a positive and respectful community.

## Code Hygiene Best Practices:
*   **Linting and Formatting:** Use linters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier for JavaScript; Black, Flake8 for Python) to enforce consistent code style and catch potential errors early.
*   **Automated Testing:** Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. Integrate testing into your CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Dependency Management:** Clearly define and manage project dependencies using tools like `package.json` (Node.js) or `go.mod` (Go/Hugo).
*   **Security Best Practices:** Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities, sanitize user input, and follow secure coding principles.

## CI/CD Best Practices:
*   **Automated Builds:** Automate the process of building your static site whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
*   **Automated Testing:** Integrate automated tests into your CI pipeline to run on every commit or pull request.
*   **Automated Deployment:** Automatically deploy your built site to a CDN or hosting provider upon successful builds and tests (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS Amplify).
*   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for sensitive data (API keys, tokens) and manage them securely within your CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Build Caching:** Optimize build times by caching dependencies and build artifacts.
*   **Rollbacks:** Plan for easy rollbacks in case of deployment issues.

## Deployment Best Practices:
*   **CDN Usage:** Deploy your static assets to a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster global delivery and improved performance.
*   **Atomic Deploys:** Ensure that deployments are atomic, meaning the entire new version of the site is deployed at once, preventing broken states during updates.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** Implement proper cache invalidation strategies to ensure users always receive the latest version of your site.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up monitoring for site performance and availability, and collect logs for debugging and analysis.
*   **Pre-rendering/SSR:** Leverage pre-rendering or Server-Side Rendering (SSR) where appropriate to improve initial load times and SEO.
*   **Image Optimization:** Optimize images for web delivery (compression, responsive images) to reduce page load times.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for images and other assets to improve initial page load performance.
*   **Code Splitting:** Split your JavaScript bundles to load only the necessary code for each page.
