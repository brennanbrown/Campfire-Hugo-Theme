# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our projects seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following information:

*   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any suggested mitigations or fixes.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to:

*   Responding to security reports in a timely manner.
*   Investigating all legitimate security reports.
*   Keeping you informed of our progress in addressing the vulnerability.
*   Publicly acknowledging your contribution if you are the first to report a vulnerability and it leads to a fix.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.

Thank you for helping to keep our projects secure.
