# Hugo Theme Specification: "Campfire" - Development Priority Order

## Brand Identity & Theme Concept

### The Campfire Story
**Campfire** üèïÔ∏è is a warm, story-focused Hugo theme that makes beautiful blogs effortless. Where great stories find their home and readers gather around the fire nspired by the timeless tradition of sharing stories around a warm fire, Campfire creates an inviting space where content creators can share their narratives and build communities around shared experiences.

### Brand Personality
- **Warm & Inviting:** Like the glow of firelight that draws people in
- **Story-Focused:** Every feature designed to enhance narrative and engagement  
- **Community-Driven:** Built for connection and conversation
- **Timeless:** Classic storytelling never goes out of style
- **Accessible:** Everyone has a place around the fire

### Visual Identity

#### Core Color Palette
```css
:root {
  /* Primary Colors - The Fire */
  --campfire-ember: #ff6b35;      /* Warm orange, primary accent */
  --campfire-flame: #ff8c42;      /* Lighter orange, secondary accent */
  --campfire-coal: #2d1b14;       /* Deep brown, dark mode primary */
  
  /* Supporting Colors - The Night Sky */
  --campfire-midnight: #1a1a2e;   /* Deep navy, main dark background */
  --campfire-twilight: #16213e;   /* Medium blue, secondary dark */
  --campfire-starlight: #f7f9fc;  /* Off-white, light mode primary */
  
  /* Neutral Colors - The Forest */

  --campfire-stone: #5a5a5a;      /* Medium gray, secondary text */
  --campfire-bark: #3a3a3a;       /* Dark gray, primary text */
}
```

#### Typography Philosophy
- **Headlines:** Warm, friendly serif (like hand-carved signs) - "Crimson Text" or "Lora"
- **Body Text:** Clean, highly readable sans-serif - "Inter" or "Source Sans Pro"  
- **Accent Text:** Casual handwritten feel for special elements - "Kalam" or "Caveat"

#### Visual Elements
- **Subtle textures:** Paper grain, wood texture overlays (very subtle)
- **Warm shadows:** Soft, glowing shadows instead of harsh edges
- **Rounded corners:** Friendly, organic shapes throughout
- **Gentle animations:** Like flickering firelight - subtle and mesmerizing
